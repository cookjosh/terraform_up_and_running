# Terraform Up and Running

## Overview
This repo is for working through the O'Reilly book of the same name. My intent is to work through the exercises, so code committed will mainly be similar, if not the same, as what is in the book. I am also intending to keep running notes for my own reference, but others may find it useful too!

## Structure
Repo for working through the O'Reilly Terraform Up and Running book. The layout of the repo will be as follows:
- `notes` - a general dir for notes. This may get split out into individual chapters. Those individual note files may be moved into chapter-specific dirs.
- `chapter_code` - as the book progresses, code will be refactored for various teaching points. I may copy the code at the end of each chapter into it's own subdir for reference to notes.
- `main_project_code` - the main dir, holding the code as it evolves throughout the book.
